"The Odin Project" JavaScript game project.

I have learned so much from just this project. My first ever Javascript code.
Even though I got it working, there is still so much I don't understand about what I've done. 
I think it's all mostly the syntax, the main concepts were ok.
I have returned some functions which I don't think I needed to. Experience will tell. 

I think this project is visited again later in the course. I'll try not to overwrite this version.
